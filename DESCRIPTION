Title: Comfort Way to Run Build Scripts

Description: Working with reproducible reports or any other similar projects often requires to run the script that builds the output file in a specified way. One can become tired from repeatedly switching to the build script and sourcing it. The 'buildr' package does this one simple thing via 'RStudio' addin â€“ user can set up the keyboard shortcut and run the build script with one keystroke anywhere anytime. The second way is to pass buildr() command to console which does the same thing. Both ways source the build.R (case insensitive) file present in the current working directory.
